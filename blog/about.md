# About The Route Rater Project

Route Rater is an app that enables cyclists to quickly and easily find or report things about cycle routes in their area. A prototype is currently in development, supported by the transport and open data community in Leeds:

* [West Yorkshire Combined Authority](http://www.westyorks-ca.gov.uk/ "WYCA") / [Metro](www.wymetro.com "Metro") / [go:cycling](http://www.wygocycling.com/ "go:cycling")
* [Leeds City Council](http://www.leeds.gov.uk/ "Leeds City Council")
* [Leeds Data Mill](http://www.leedsdatamill.org/ "Leeds Data Mill")
* [ODI-Leeds](http://theodi.org/nodes/leeds "ODI Leeds")
