# Route Rater

An idea developed at the ODI Leeds #hackmyroute day. 

The initial idea was to create a colour-coded map of the streets using crowd sourcing. It developed to include a feedback mechanism where cyclists could easily report things about their route.


## Classes of route:

* Green (Beginner): Off-road/separate to vehicles/gentle gradients
* Blue (Intermediate): Some or limited experience. Residential roads/low traffic/slow speeds.
* Red (Hard): Busy roads/heavy traffic/filter lanes/big roundabouts/traffic lights
* Black (Extreme): Multi-lane sections/gyratories/lots of experience and luck
